# 🌟 Welcome to PCA Made Simple!

This project demonstrates how to use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction on datasets:

1. **Breast Cancer Dataset** (from Scikit-learn)
2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset** (from a CSV file)

Let’s dive into the power of PCA with easy-to-follow examples and stunning visualizations! 📉✨
